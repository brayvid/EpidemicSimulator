# Epidemic Simulator
<h3>WARNING: This program is not a reliable source of epidemiological information. Do not use it for anything important. Bugs are guaranteed.</h3>

<p>This program simulates a disease spreading through a community in random motion. Parameters include the population and overall population density, the number of trials to conduct, and the number of units that an individual should move per timestep per unit of 'playable' area. Individuals are represented as points undergoing independent random walks in a bounded two dimensional environment. After a random period of time between a given minimum and maximum, infected individuals either recover or die. The probability of death varies by age group: <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics">https://worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics</a> and <a href="https://newyork.areaconnect.com/statistics.htm">https://newyork.areaconnect.com/statistics.htm</a>.</p>
